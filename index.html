          <h2>Practical outcomes for small businesses and lean teams.</h2>
          <p>
            A good CRM should make revenue work visible and repeatable. It should help
            you respond quicker, stop leads slipping through gaps, and give owners a clear
            view of what is happening in the pipeline right now.

              Website forms, email conversations, and inbound messages are logged into a
