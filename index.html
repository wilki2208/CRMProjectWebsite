            Most CRMs get more expensive as your team grows. BusinessApp is different:
            you pay once for a tailored rollout, we deploy it, train your team, and hand
            you the codebase so it is yours to run, adapt, and scale. You get the full
            platform, and you decide which features and workflows your business actually uses.

          <p class="eyebrow">The problem</p>
          <h2>CRM platforms are bloated, overpriced, and hard to escape.</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional CRMs push you into recurring contracts, per-seat pricing, and
            feature bundles you never asked for. Small businesses end up paying more
            every year while getting less control over their own process and data.

            <h3>Per-user pricing punishes growth</h3>
            <p>
              Add more staff, add more cost. The commercial model scales against you,
              even when your needs are simple and stable.

            <p>
              Off-the-shelf CRMs force you to work their way. Core workflows are often
              hidden behind feature tiers, upgrade prompts, or expensive add-ons.
